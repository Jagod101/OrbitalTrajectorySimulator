# Orbital Trajectory Simulator
Create a program to simulate an orbital trajectory or  use the rocket equation to simulate the timeline of the loss of mass from launch to on orbit and  end of life

## Authors
* Zach Jagoda
* Justin Saborouh

## Goals
- [ ]To create a functioning program that simulates a spacecraft from launch to it's final destination
- [ ]Add graphical interface to script to give better illustration of Orbital Trajectory of the Spacecraft in the simulation
- [ ]Add multiple variations to destination: expand off of Earth to Moon (ex: Earth to Mars/Jupiter/Saturn/etc...)

## Formal Report

## Installation
- Required software to run program
  - Python (2.7)
  - Git Bash
- Downloading Repository
  - Clone onto your personal computer; navigate to preffered folder before getting repository
  - Use 'git clone' and paste the https:// link for the repository into the Git Bash window
- Adding Other Branches (only necessary if you plan on contributing)
  - Your current branch will most likely be the 'master' branch, but it's a good idea to not work in master
  - By typing 'git checkout origin/dev' you will be able to access the remote
  - Now re-type the previous line but slightly modified; 'git checkout -b dev origin/dev'
  - The dev branch (or your desired branch) should be added now
  - To check your current branch use 'git branch'
  - To change your branch use 'git checkout <insert branch name>'
