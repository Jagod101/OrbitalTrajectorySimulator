# Orbital Trajectory Simulator
Create a program to simulate an orbital trajectory or  use the rocket equation to simulate the timeline of the loss of mass from launch to on orbit and  end of life

# Authors
Zach Jagoda
Justin Saborouh

# Goals
- To create a functioning program that simulates a spacecraft from launch to it's final destination
- Add graphical interface to script to give better illustration of Orbital Trajectory of the Spacecraft in the simulation
- Add multiple variations to destination: expand off of Earth to Moon (ex: Earth to Mars/Jupiter/Saturn/etc...)
