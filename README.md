# Orbital Trajectory Simulator
Create a program to simulate an orbital trajectory or  use the rocket equation to simulate the timeline of the loss of mass from launch to on orbit and  end of life

## Authors
* Zach Jagoda
* Justin Saborouh

## Professor
* Mirella Valencia

## Goals
- [X] To create a functioning program that simulates a spacecraft from launch to it's final destination
- [X] Add graphical interface to script to give better illustration of Orbital Trajectory of the Spacecraft in the simulation
- [ ] Add multiple variations to destination: expand off of Earth to Moon (ex: Earth to Mars/Jupiter/Saturn/etc...)

## Project Guidelines
The project you are assigned to for this class is in the Assigned Prompts section of this project assignment. This can be a partner, group or an individual project. Use this as an opportunity to reflect on how you already know you work best and then I suggest you choose the OPPOSITE to help yourself improve how you work as a team member or individually. Regardless of project prompt you are assigned, you will be required to turn in a deliverable at the end of the semester on the day that you present. The individual prompts will underline specific items to be included in the substance part of the deliverable. However generally the expectation is a beginning, middle and end in terms of the following but is not limited to:
Describe what your project is about
Explain why you selected the topic (not the prompt)
Provide your methods of research (not bibliography)
Provide the substance of your research that satisfies the prompt (this will be the bulk of your report)
Conclude your findings, what you learned and anything else relating to the project in particular
Generally your deliverable should be on the order of magnitude of 10-12 pages (not including bibliography, cover page, etc…). There is no penalty for turning in more than 12 pages. If you are working in a group, each person must provide their own DISTINCT report (I expect 28 separate reports). If you collaborate on anything, it is fine to duplicate it in your reports, however you MUST individually provide which section of the collaborated work is a result of your input. Give and take credit where it is due.
We will also have Project Presentations on December 8, 2016 for the duration of the class. Regardless of group or individual project, everyone will need to prepare to present 5 minutes per person. (A 2 person project will take 10 minutes to present, vs an individual will speak for 5 minutes flat) I suggest the presentation be in powerpoint format however that is not required if you have an alternative method of presentation. Please send me anything that you will be presenting before class on 12/8 so that we can operate off the computer in the classroom from my account and not have to bother with the hassle of switching medium.

###Important dates to keep in mind:
- [X] Project Outline – 10/6/16
- [X] Draft One – 11/3/16
- [ ] Final Draft/Project Presentation – 12/8/16

## Project Prompt
Create a program to simulate an orbital trajectory or use the rocket equation to simulate the timeline of the loss of mass from launch to on orbit and end of life. Provide code as part of deliverable. Also included as the substance of the deliverable, a report that discusses the current tools used in the industry to optimize the orbital trajectories that are implemented on Earth based and interplanetary mission designs. What challenges do these programs come across and what has been the history of better perfecting the way orbits and mass/power simulations are performed? What solution to some of these problems can you work to innovate to continue enhancing these existent tools?

## Formal Report

## Installation
- Required software to run program
  - Python (2.7)
  - Git Bash
- Downloading Repository
  - Clone onto your personal computer; navigate to preffered folder before getting repository
  - Use 'git clone' and paste the https:// link for the repository into the Git Bash window
- Adding Other Branches (only necessary if you plan on contributing)
  - Your current branch will most likely be the 'master' branch, but it's a good idea to not work in master
  - By typing 'git checkout origin/dev' you will be able to access the remote
  - Now re-type the previous line but slightly modified; 'git checkout -b dev origin/dev'
  - The dev branch (or your desired branch) should be added now
  - To check your current branch use 'git branch'
  - To change your branch use 'git checkout <insert branch name>'
